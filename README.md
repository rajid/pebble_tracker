Pebble Tracker program notes
=============================

Simple time tracking program for up to five projects. You can edit the project names and times using "Settings" on the phone.
It's ok to run a different application while a project is being tracked and it's ok to assign time to multiple projects at once.
Resetting to zero can be done by holding down the middle button for 1 second.
The program also tracks the bluetooth connection and displays a bluetooth symbol (with a buzz) when signal status changes.

I decided to put this source up in github because I don't tend to use the program as much as I did previously.

Some thoughts on possible work:
-------------------------------

* Some people had some ideas about making the configuration page more dynamic, adding new project input fields as needed.
* There were thoughts of adding configuration to guarantee that only one project is running at a time.

If you make changes and would like me to add them to the official version,
please contact me at <raj@mischievous.us>.
